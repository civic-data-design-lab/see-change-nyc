					<h1 class="m2">Evolving Streets</h1>
					<p class="b1">Restrictions following the COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed how we use the streets. This
						visualization explores New York City’s streets pre- and post-COVID-19 restrictions, allowing us to see the
						dramatic changes to the ways New York City’s streets were used in the early stages of the pandemic. Notice
						the disturbing new clusters of people near New York City hospitals and the dramatic decrease in people in
						Midtown Manhattan. </p>
					<p class="b1">New York City’s sidewalks have always been filled with pedestrians, but more recently the
						sharing economy has transformed the way we use our streets. Pedestrians now share the streets with delivery
						trucks, for-hire-vehicles, scooters, and bicycle stations. Demand for pedestrian-friendly streets will be
						essential for New York City’s electoral body to consider.</p>

						<h4 class="m2">Data Description/Process</h4>
						<p class="b1"><em>Mobility LBS Data</em><br>
							Anonymized and privacy-enhanced mobility data was provided by Cuebiq. According to their website, their
							first-party data is collected from anonymized users who have opted in to provide access to their location
							data anonymously through a GDPR-compliant framework.</p>
						<p class="b1">This data is derived from more than 100 smartphone applications that have integrated Cuebiq's
							Software Development Kit. Because the data comes from applications we use on our cell phones, it skews
							towards populations who own smartphones in general; it should be noted that there is a potential to
							undercount seniors.
						</p>
						<p class="b1">In addition to de-identifying the data, the data provider also applies privacy enhancements to
							remove sensitive locations and personal (home/work) areas from the dataset. Data was shared in June 2020
							under a strict contract with Cuebiq through their Data for Good program, where all researchers are
							contractually obligated to not share or attempt to de-identify data. In total, our sample contained about
							1.1 million unique users in January and 0.5 million unique users in April. We only considered pings that
							happened within the five boroughs of New York City during the weeks of February 23&ndash;29 and March
							29&ndash;April 4.</p>
						<p class="b1"><em>Understand Who is Really On the Streets</em><br>
							As we were interested in understanding where people could potentially meet, we extracted stays from the
							individual trajectories, represented by sequences of pings made when users spend some time in a place.
							Those sequences of pings are spatially limited to small regions, and to detect them we used the algorithm
							info-stop, created by Ulf Aslak (2020), in which a set of consecutive pings are clustered together if
							their maximum distance from their centroid is not larger than 10 meters. The duration of a stay is the
							time between the first and last ping belonging to a cluster. Here, we only used stays with durations
							between 2 minutes and 1 day. After using this algorithm and discarding users who did not have any stays,
							we were left with a total of 4 million stays over two weeks in New York City. </p>
						<p class="b1"><em>Attribution of Stays to Streets</em><br>
							To attribute a stay to a street, we assigned each stay to the closest street in our dataset. To avoid
							attributing a stay to a distant street, we chose only the closest street within a radius of 30 meters for
							each stay. If a stay was farther than 30 meters, we did not attribute it to any street. We further
							calculated the average number of stays during different time intervals for weekdays and weekends
							separately, namely 12:00&ndash;5:00 am, 6:00&ndash;1:00 am, 12:00&ndash;5:00 pm, and 6:00&ndash;11:00 pm.
							To only consider the pedestrian-related activities, we remove stays that were longer than 2 hours. Lastly,
							given the fact that streets have different lengths, we divided the accumulated count of stays by street
							length.
						</p>
						<p class="b1">To calculate changes in footfall data from late February to early April, we processed both
							absolute difference and relative change calculations. More specifically, we used percentage relative
							changes for the street segments with footfall data values greater than 0 both in February and March. We
							also recorded -100% relative change segments those streets with a value greater than 0 in February and 0
							in March. Similarly, we considered as +100% relative change segments those streets with a value greater
							than 0 in March and equal to 0 in February. In addition to relative changes, we calculated absolute change
							values to better grasp the magnitude of the data values across time. </p>


						<h4 class="m2">Data Limitations</h4>
						<p class="b1">As our primary data is collected from smartphone applications (apps), we acknowledge that our
							sample might not represent the complete street users. Studies done by Moro (2020) using data from Cuebiq
							2017 data shows that the dataset does not have significant biases in income distribution, although they
							acknowledged that the average income of users in the sample is slightly higher than the census data
							(around 8.6%).</p>
