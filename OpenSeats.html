					In a 2010 referendum, the New York City voters voted to reinstate the two-term limit. However, incumbent council members who were elected to office on or before November 2, 2010 could complete their current term and go on to serve up to two additional four-year terms. Now, after a decade since the two-term limit has been reinstated, the New York City will see an unprecedented 41 open seats&mdash;35 City Council positions, 4 Borough Presidents, the Comptroller, and the Mayor&mdash;available for the 2021 election. For these 41 seats open for the 2021 election, the incumbent Council Members will reach their term limit and will not eligible to run for the 2022&ndash;2025 term. In 2022, a majority of the elected positions on the New York City Council may be filled by new faces.				</div>
