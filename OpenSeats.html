					<h1 class="m2">2021 Open Seats</h1>
					<p>In a 2010 referendum, the New York City voters voted to reinstate the two-term limit. However, incumbent council members who were elected to office on or before November 2, 2010 could complete their current term and go on to serve up to two additional four-year terms. Now, after a decade since the two-term limit has been reinstated, the New York City will see an unprecedented 41 seats with no incumbents running&mdash;35 City Council positions, 4 Borough Presidents, the Comptroller, and the Mayor&mdash;available for the 2021 election. This means we are set to see an unprecedented change in New York City’s leadership. Will these new leaders have the experience or vision to transform New York City’s future?</p>
