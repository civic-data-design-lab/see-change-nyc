					The Urban Heat Island Effect, an elevation in air temperature in urban areas relative to nearby rural areas, has had a measurable negative impact on many regions across NYC, especially during the summer months. To mitigate the effects of extreme heat as a threat to public health, the NYC Heat Vulnerability Index was developed as a tool to assess the vulnerability of heat-sensitive neighborhoods through a combination of social and environmental factors. As cited on the NYC Environment and Health Data Portal, "The New York City (NYC) Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) is a measure of how the risk of heat-related illness or death differs across neighborhoods. Neighborhood risk factors that increase heat vulnerability in NYC are: less home air conditioning, less green space, hotter surface temperatures, and more residents who are low-income or non-Latinx Black."
