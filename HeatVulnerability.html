					<h1 class="m2">Heat Vulnerability</h1>
					<p>The Urban Heat Island Effect, an elevation in air temperature in urban areas relative to nearby rural areas, has had a measurable negative impact on many regions across NYC, especially during the summer months. To mitigate the effects of extreme heat as a threat to public health, the NYC Heat Vulnerability Index was developed as a tool to assess the vulnerability of heat-sensitive neighborhoods through a combination of social and environmental factors.</p>
					<p>As cited on the <a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/VisualizationData.aspx?id=2191,719b87,107,Summarize" target="_blank">NYC Environment and Health Data Portal</a>, "The New York City (NYC) Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) is a measure of how the risk of heat-related illness or death differs across neighborhoods. Neighborhood risk factors that increase heat vulnerability in NYC are: less home air conditioning, less green space, hotter surface temperatures, and more residents who are low-income or non-Latinx Black."</p>
					<h4 class="m2">Data Description/Process</h4>
					<p>We explored how the unique combination of five individual factors contribute to a single Heat Vulnerability Index score for each neighborhood community district. Through the NYC Environment and Health Data Portal, we gathered datasets of the social and environmental factors from the American Community Survey (2013-2017 5-yr estimates), New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (2017), U. S. Geological Survey LandSat (2018), and United States Census Housing and Vacancy Survey (2017).</p>
					<p>For social factors for each neighborhood, the <a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/VisualizationData.aspx?id=2185,719b87,107,Summarize" target="_blank">air conditioning</a> factor represents the estimated percentage of households reporting having functioning air conditioning, the poverty factor represents the percentage of people living below the federal poverty level, and the non-Latinx Black factor represents the percentage of non‚ÄêLatinx Black residents. For environmental factors for each neighborhood, the <a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/VisualizationData.aspx?id=2141,719b87,107,Summarize" target="_blank">daytime surface temperature</a> factor represents the daytime LANDSAT thermal data on surface on July 17, 2018, averaged spatially, and the <a href="http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/VisualizationData.aspx?id=2143,719b87,107,Summarize" target="_blank">vegetative cover</a> factor represents the percentage of each geographic area that is covered in vegetation, as recorded by spatial information classifying ground cover.</p>
					<h4 class="m2">Data Limitations</h4>
					<p>The data for daytime surface temperature is from one day, July 17, 2018. There is also a missing distinction between recorded outdoor and indoor temperature, whose differences can vary greatly depending on other factors, including an access to air conditioning and living space arrangements and location. One example of additional work that has been conducted on this end is the <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/series/harlem-heat-project" target="_blank">Harlem Heat Project</a>.</p>
