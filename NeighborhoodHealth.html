					Resources and opportunities—such as secure jobs with benefits, well-maintained and affordable housing, accessible transportation, healthy and affordable food, and quality of education and healthcare—are the fundamentals of good health, and are distributed inequitably throughout New York City.<sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup> This visualization highlights health inequities and resource disparities in New York City by providing the indexical value of factors from demographic, socioeconomic, housing, and neighborhood data at community district level. Using a radar chart method, a unique shape is given to each community district to visualize the hidden gaps and patterns of unequal distribution of resources and opportunities that contribute to disease burden and differences in life expectancy in the city.

					<h4 class="m2">Data Description/Process</h4>
					<p class="b1">The metadata for neighborhood health comes from the 2018 Community Health Profiles Public Use Dataset<sup><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a></sup>  The data compiles many sources, such as from the American Community Survey (ACS), the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), Community Health Survey (CHS) indicators, the New York University (NYU) Furman Center, and NYC Housing and Vacancy Survey (HVS) indicators, which have been modified to reflect Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA). For the purpose of this visualization, factors such as poverty, unemployment, rent burden, homes with roaches, bike network coverage, unmet medical care needs, childhood asthma, and more were scaled to a score of 1 to 10.</p>
					<h4 class="m2">Data Limitations</h4>
					<p class="b1">Most estimates were evaluated for statistical stability. Estimates with a relative standard error (RSE) greater than 30% or with a small sample size or small numbers of events (less than or equal to 10) are flagged as follows: “Interpret estimate with caution due to small number of events or small sample size.” Where noted in the metadata, estimates were age standardized to the Year 2000 Standard Population.</p>
