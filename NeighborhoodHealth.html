				<div id="project-description">
					Resources and opportunities are the fundamentals of good health, including secured jobs with benefits, well-maintained and affordable housing, accessible transportation, healthy and affordable food, and quality of education and health care, which are distributed inequitably throughout NYC. Neighborhood Health highlights the issues of health inequities and resource disparities in New York City by providing the indexical value of factors from demographic, socioeconomic to housing and neighborhood infrastructural on borough at community district level. Using a radar chart method, an unique shape is given to each community district to visualize the hidden gaps and patterns of unequal distribution of resources and opportunities that contribute to health burden and differences in life expectancy.
