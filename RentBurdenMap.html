					<h1 class="m2">Rent Burden</h1>
					<p class="b1"> Affordable housing is one of the biggest issues New Yorkers face, with some estimates stating
						that more than 1.2 million households in the city are rent burdened,<sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup>
						meaning that they spend 30% or more of their income on rent. These visualizations show the proportion of
						income that households in each census block group spend on rent. The concentric circles from green to blue
						illustrate this point with green representing not rent burdened households (less than 30%), light blue
						representing rent burdened households (30-50%), and dark blue representing severely rent burdened households
						(over 50%), according to definitions drawn from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.<sup><a
								href="#ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Most census block groups have a mix of all three, but the areas where there
						is more blue means more rent burden. Where do New York City's next leaders need to focus their energy to
						make sure the city is affordable for everyone? </p>

						<h4 class="m2">Data Description/Process</h4>
						<p class="b1">The map data represents block group data taken from the American Community Survey (5-Year
							Estimates, 2014-2018). The ridge line graphic was created by the American Community Survey’s Public Use
							Microdata (PUMs). PUMs data includes every answer to the census questions, allowing anyone to cross
							tabulate data. This was important for the rent burden visualizations because this is the only data that
							allows you to see households that are severely rent-burdened (paying more than 50% of their income on
							rent) with pre-tabulated data. ACS PUMs come from the Census API and the Tidy Census package in RStudio.
						</p>

						<h4 class="m2">Data Limitations</h4>
						<p class="b1">The American Community Survey is a supplemental survey to the decennial census. The survey
							represents 1% of the American population. The survey data was weighted using the weights provided from the
							US Census, using the “survey” package in RStudio. PUMs data is manipulated and limited to maintain
							privacy. It is also limited to geographic areas of 100,000 people or more called PUMA districts. PUMAs in
							NYC are roughly equivalent to Community Districts.<sup><a href="#ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
						<p class="b1">The data shows that some households spent either less than 0% of their income on rent or more
							than 100% of their income on rent. We cannot determine if these individuals are rent burdened, as they are
							likely to have outside financial support or a specific financial situation (such as a student living in an
							off-campus apartment). Therefore, households spending 0% or 100% of their income on rent were not
							included.</p>
						<p class="b1">While HUD has set a standardized definition of rent burden, it is difficult to draw definitive
							boundaries on who is, in fact, rent burdened. The presence of children and commuting costs, among other
							factors, can add additional strain to the cost of living in New York City, which is not captured in the
							data. These are estimates based on the HUD numbers. </p>
