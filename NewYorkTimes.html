        <p>Using the New York Times API, all articles which mentioned the New Your City Council were downloaded since the de Blasio Mayoral election (January 2013- Summer 2020). 2,510 articles were then run through a machine learning topics modeler to identify the topics of the articles. Using that data this visualization allows us to understand the biggest issues City Council has faced over the last seven years from the Foie Gras Ban to Education.  </p>
        <h4 class="m2">Data Limitations</h4>
        <p>It is possible that some articles were missed during the New York Times API search because the article might not have mentioned “city council”  but the topic was related to an issue on the City Council’s agenda. The machine learning algorithm uses all the text from all the articles to create topics, this means there is no indicator of what article directly contributed to a topic being identified. Therefore the relationship between articles and topics are relative.
