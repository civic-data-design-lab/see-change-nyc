      <div id="project-description">
        Using the New York Times API, all articles which mentioned the New Your City Council were downloaded since the
        de Blasio Mayoral election (January 2013- Summer 2020). The articles were then run through a machine learning
        topics modeler to identify the topics of the articles. Using that data this visualization allows us to
        understand the biggest issues City Council has faced over the last seven years from the Foie Gras Ban to
        Education. <br><br>
        <b>[Data Limitations]</b><br>
        It is possible that their articles that were missed during the API search because they might not have mentioned
        city council in the article itself but the topic was related to a city councilor. It was hard to rematch all
        articles to their topic as the machine learning algorithm doesn’t tag which article was used to develop the
        topic, so the research team reverse engineered the link between the topics and the articles. This means that the
        topics associated with the articles are relative to the overall number of articles in the dataset. <br><br>
